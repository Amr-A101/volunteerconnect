## Problem

Volunteer opportunities are often scattered across social media and informal channels. This makes it difficult for volunteers to find suitable roles and for organizations to manage applicants efficiently.

## Solution

Volunteer Connect provides a centralized platform where:
- Volunteers can create profiles, search opportunities, and apply online.
- Organizations can post opportunities, review applications, and manage volunteers.
- Administrators can oversee platform activity.

## Features

- Multi-role authentication (Volunteer, Organization, Admin)
- Opportunity listing and search filtering
- Application and approval workflow
- Basic volunteer-opportunity matching
- Real-time notifications
- Messaging system
- Ratings and reviews
- Role-based dashboards

## Tech Stack

- PHP (Backend logic)
- MySQL (Database)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Apache / XAMPP (Local server)

## What I Learned

- Designing role-based system architecture
- Implementing application workflow logic
- Handling state management (pending / approved / rejected)
- Balancing feature development with maintainability
- Iterative UI improvement based on testing feedback

## Future Improvements

- Stronger separation of concerns (MVC structure)
- API layer restructuring
- Improved UI/UX consistency
- Deployment to production environment
